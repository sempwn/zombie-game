            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

            <p>The main task is to calculate the epidemiological parameters by comparing the
            output of mathematical models to data and investigate what kinds of interventions
            would be required in order to control the outbreak.</p>






            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
            <p>One of the main goals in modelling of infectious diseases is
            to be able to understand the Basic Reproduction Number or R0, but what
            actually is it? The exact definition is:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="lead text-center">
                <p class="mb-0">The average number of secondary cases for every
                    primary case in a completely susceptible population
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This may sound complicated, but it's fairly easy to understand.
                As an example, imagine a person is infected and passes the
                infection on to two people. Then one of those people passes the
                infection on to one other person and the other passes it on to
                three people. On average each person infected two other people,
                so we would estimate the R0 of that disease to be 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the tool below to explore the consequences of different
                R0 values. An epidemic is simulated for three generations and
                who infects who are connected by lines.
            </p>
            <div class="form-inline">
                <div class="col-md-3">

                    <div class="input-group number-spinner">
                        <span class="input-group-btn data-dwn">

                        <span class="input-group-btn data-up">
                            <button class="btn btn-default btn-info" data-dir="up"><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                </div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="r0Diagram"></div>
            <p>
                Notice that if R0 is below one then the epidemic is not likely
                to get to the third generation. If it's above one then this is
                possible. It turns out after a long time, if the R0 is less than
                one then the infection is guaranteed to die out, however if it
                is bigger than one then there's a probability it will persist
                and continue to become an epidemic. Estimating the R0 is therefore
                vitally important for public health intervention.
            </p>

        <h2 id="modelfitting">Model fitting</h2>
        <p>
            In order to calculate the R0 and other values of interest, we need
            some way of comparing a model to data. We can do this by looking
            at the <strong>mean squared error</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Look at the example below. Here we have a simple model that has two
            parameters: one that controls how steep the gradient of the output is
            and another that controls where the output intersects at zero. The
            mean squared error can be calculated by compaing each data point to the
            model and squaring the difference. All these are averaged (and a
            square root is also taken) to produce the mean squared error. The
            important thing is that the best model parameters are the ones that
            provide a smallest error.

        <h2 id="different models">Model comparisons</h2>

        <p>
            Diseases have many different modes of spreading either directly or
            through another organism like a mosquito. Diseases also have quite
            varied biological characteristics such as how long it can remain
            in a host before they become infectious. We use models to explore
            the consequences of these different phenomena and compare them to
            data in order to provide evidence as to which one is correct.
        </p>
        <p>
            A list of likely models for the pathogen are given below.
        </p>

        <h3 id="directcontactmodel">Direct contact model</h3>

        <p>
        The simplest model we can consider is where the pathogen is spread
        through direct contact with people who are infected. Also someone
        who gets infected immediately becomes infectious themselves. Here's
        what the model looks like:
        </p>

        <div id="SIRdiagram" class="text-center"></div>

        <p>It turns out from this model we can derive the $R_0$ as</p>

        <p>$$R_0 = \frac{\text{infectivity}}{\text{rate of recovery}}$$</p>

        <p>For this and similar models there is a threshold and if we can
            vaccinate above this then the pathogen is guaranteed to
            be eliminated:</p>

        <p>$$1- \frac{1}{R_0}$$</p>

        <p> As an example measles has an $R_0$ of about 13, which means optimal vaccination
            coverage is 92%.</p>


        <h3 id="vectorbornemodel">Vector-borne model</h3>

        <p>The vector borne model is split into two compartments: humans and
            vectors (mosquitos, fleas, birds etc.). Humans aren't infected
            directly, but rather through the vector. If the vector was a mosquito
            then a susceptible vector bites an infected person and incubates
            the pathogen becoming infected itself. The vector then bites a
            susceptible person transmitting the pathogen.
        </p>



        <h3 id = "latentclassmodel">Latent model</h3>

        <p>Some pathogens may have a latent stage before an individual becomes Infectious.
        Typically this is called the $E$ or exposed stage </p>
        <p> The progression of the pathogen would look something like this: </p>

        <div id="SEIRdiagram" class="text-center"></div>

        <p>
            The $R_0$ is the same as for the direct-contact model, but the
            latent stage changes how quickly the epidemic advances
        </p>

        <h3>Modelling Tasks</h3>

            Use the menu above to navigate to the different sections. Use the
            <a href="./fitting.html">fitting </a>  section
            to compare the models to data and work out what the best parameters
            are that match the observed epidemic. Then use these parameters
            to <a href="./simulation.html">simulate </a> what
            might happen if an outbreak occurred in North America and what
            interventions might be necessary to stop the outbreak.

            <p>If you're curious about the equations used for each of these models

            <p>$$R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$$</p>

            <h4> Vector-borne model </h4>

            <p>$$\frac{dx}{dt} = mabz(1-x) - rx$$
            $$\frac{dz}{dt} = acx(e^{-g\nu} - z) - gz$$</p>
