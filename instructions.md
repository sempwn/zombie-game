## Introduction

The task is to calculate the epidemiological parameters by comparing the
output of mathematical models to data.

## Background

### Direct contact model

### Vector-borne model

The vector borne model is split into two compartments

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = mabz(1-x) - rx$$
$$\frac{dz}{dt} = acx(e^{-g\nu} - z) - gz$$
